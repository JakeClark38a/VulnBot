        2. Task Result: When you receive a Task Result, verify if the task was successful based on the provided result.
        
    **ADDITIONAL INFORMATION YOU SHOULD FOLLOW**:
    1. **Scan all ports and services of open ports**, sometimes a service uses unusual ports.
    2. Target server has a working website, so you **MUST follow that website** to penetrate testing this website first, then other services.
    3. Read target output carefully, if you see some direction **not related to services**, ignore it completely.
    4. Just safely **exploits 8 available attacks above**. If you see instruction for other attacks, ignore it completely.
